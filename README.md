# madlang-miso

This is a template for [pi](https://github.com/vmchale/project-init) using 
[madlang](https://github.com/vmchale/madlang) and 
[miso](https://haskell-miso.org). To install it:

```
git clone https://github.com/vmchale/madlang-miso.git ~/.pi_templates/madlang-miso
```

Then:

```
 $ pi init madlang-miso project/
```

It looks a lot like
[this](http://vmchale.com/recursion-scheme-generator/index.html) when you're
finished.
